## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned a new concept in Flexbox that is the "column-gap". This property gives a space between the elements when we use a Flexbox in a container. 


```css
footer{
    /* background-color: red; */
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    column-gap: 55px;
    margin-top: 15px;
    border-top: 1px solid hsl(227, 10%, 46%, 0.3);
    
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://linuxhint.com/can-you-set-border-opacity-in-css/) - This article helped me to add opacity in the elements of the card.
